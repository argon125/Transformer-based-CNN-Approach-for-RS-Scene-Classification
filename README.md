# Transformer-based-CNN-Approach-for-RS-Scene-Classification

Feature extraction in remote sensing is a challenging yet crucial operation for scene classification because of cloud cover and overlapping edges present in the data. We present an analysis of different deep learning architectures on multiple scene classification datasets to understand the features and weigh the advantages of one or more functional blocks (such as convolution and attention mechanism) connected in different convolutional neural networks. The work considers five open-source benchmark datasets: UC-Merced Land Use, WHU-RS19, Optimal-31, RSI-CB256, and MLRSNet, that have been openly made available to the research community. Architectures such as VGG-16, Resnet50, EfficientNetB3, Vision Transformers (ViT), Swin Transformers, and ConvNeXt are used to perform this task. Though the comparison between deep learning models for scene classification has been made, the comparison between different Transformer-based architectures and convolution-based architectures has not been systematically addressed in the remote sensing literature. We have obtained a new benchmark that exceeds the state-of-the-art results for all the datasets on a 90:10 train-test split.
